The headline was changed from 'Black Friday Blowout' to '秋の感謝セール' (Autumn Thanksgiving Sale) to convey a sense of gratitude and respect, which is highly valued in Japanese culture. The call-to-action (CTA) was also modified from 'Shop Now' to '期間限定のお得なオファーを詳しく見る' (See the limited-time offer in detail) to encourage customers to take a more thoughtful and considered approach, rather than acting impulsively. Additionally, the body of the campaign was rewritten to include polite language and phrases, such as '季節のご挨拶を申し上げます' (We offer you our seasonal greetings) and '心からお客様に喜んでいただきたい' (We hope you will be delighted from the heart), to create a sense of harmony and respect. These changes will help to build trust and rapport with Japanese customers, ultimately leading to a more successful campaign.","keyChanges":[{"change":"Headline change from 'Black Friday Blowout' to '秋の感謝セール'","culturalReason":"To convey a sense of gratitude and respect, which is highly valued in Japanese culture"},{"change":"CTA change from 'Shop Now' to '期間限定のお得なオファーを詳しく見る'","culturalReason":"To encourage customers to take a more thoughtful and considered approach, rather than acting impulsively"},{"change":"Inclusion of polite language and phrases in the body of the campaign","culturalReason":"To create a sense of harmony and respect, and to build trust and rapport with Japanese customers"}],"marketingImpact":"The culturally adapted version is expected to perform better in the Japanese market due to its emphasis on respect, harmony, and quality, which are core values in Japanese culture.
